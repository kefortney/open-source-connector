Welcome to the Open Source Connector GitHub repository! This project aims to create a new forum for collaboration and knowledge sharing around open-source software development in Vermont and the surrounding region. Our goal is to support engagement between academia, industry, and government while driving real impact in the local community.

Open source software has become increasingly popular due to its accessibility, transparency, and potential for innovation. The Open Source Connector project recognizes the importance of open source practices and seeks to promote them in Vermont. We believe that this will not only benefit the local tech community but also contribute to the growth of the open-source movement as a whole.

The project plan is to hold monthly events that include workshops, problem-solving exercises, and presentations related to open-source software development. These events will be hosted on a rotating basis between the University of Vermont, Champlain College, and local tech hubs. Our aim is to create a safe and welcoming environment that is inclusive and accessible to a diverse group of participants. We will work to ensure that the workshops and presentations are tailored to the needs and interests of the attendees and provide practical skills and knowledge that can be applied in real-world situations.

We are excited to launch this project and hope to see a vibrant community of open-source enthusiasts emerge in Vermont. By working together, we can drive innovation and create meaningful impact through the power of open source. We invite you to join us on this journey and contribute to the Open Source Connector project.
