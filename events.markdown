## Chapel and Open Productive Parallel Computing at Scale

**Wednesday, February 7, 2024 at 6:30-8:00 PM E**
In this talk, Michael Ferguson compares the performance of sorting implementations in different languages and explore Chapel, the programming language with the fastest standard library sort. By effectively using the parallel hardware, Chapel’s sort is 10 times faster than any other standard library sort measured on the benchmark system, and about 200 times faster than sorting with Python. Bring along a computer with a Linux or Mac environment to enable experimenting with Chapel.

Chapel is designed to make parallel computing easier and it enables programs to scale from laptops to supercomputers. Users of Chapel are reaping its benefits in practical, cutting-edge applications in many domains including data science, image analysis, and physical simulation. Additionally, Chapel has recently started to provide a vendor-neutral way to program GPUs. It’s open source and available at https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/ . More information is available on the https://chapel-lang.org/ website

This event is open and free to everyone and we will also have PIZZA!

### Location
Center for Communication and Creative Media, Room 221
375 Maple St, Burlington, VT 05401
Or
a Zoom Link will be put in the comments on the day off the event

### Presenter
Michael Ferguson is a principal software engineer at HPE within the Chapel team. He focuses primarily on improving the Chapel language and its compiler, and he has worked in many areas of the Chapel project; from LLVM-based code generation to I/O support. He's currently the technical leader of an effort to dramatically improve the compiler, including making it more interactive and reducing compile times. He has taught several multi-day Chapel tutorials and has presented work on Chapel at conferences.

In today's fast-changing tech scene, open source communities are like bustling hubs where folks come together to create, learn, and work as a team. But making these communities work isn't just about tech know-how; it's about understanding people, too. In our discussion, we'll dive into how to grow and support these communities so they're welcoming, effective, and built to last with experience learned in the open source ecosystem in Africa.

This event is open and free to everyone and we will also have PIZZA!

### Presenter
Samson Goddy is a seasoned open source program manager and developer relations (DevRel) professional with over a decade of experience in the field. He's significantly involved in community building and advocacy within the open source sphere. As a software engineer and open source advocate, he co-founded Open Source Community Africa, an initiative to foster and support the open source movement in Africa.


## Exploring Open Source Licenses

**Wed, Sep 27, 2023 6:30pm to 8:00pm**

Open source licenses are the legal agreements that govern how open source software (software that anyone can use, modify, and redistribute) can be used. In this inaugural talk for the Open Source Connector, we will discuss the basics of understanding open source licenses including:
* What are your rights and responsibilities when you incorporate an open source library in your program?
* Why we have licenses?
* What are the different types of open source licenses?
* What are the best practices for an open source practitioner?
By understanding the different types of licenses and their implications, you can make informed decisions about how to use open source software in your projects.

This event is open and free to everyone and we will also have PIZZA!
