## Exploring Open Source Licenses

**Wed, Sep 27, 2023 6:30pm to 8:00pm**

[VIEW RECORDING]([https://www.meetup.com/open-source-connector/events/295961599](https://youtu.be/rtS8tUccATI?si=FosJCAb4shoXLLrV))

Open source licenses are the legal agreements that govern how open source software (software that anyone can use, modify, and redistribute) can be used. In this inaugural talk for the Open Source Connector, we will discuss the basics of understanding open source licenses including:
* What are your rights and responsibilities when you incorporate an open source library in your program?
* Why we have licenses?
* What are the different types of open source licenses?
* What are the best practices for an open source practitioner?
By understanding the different types of licenses and their implications, you can make informed decisions about how to use open source software in your projects.

This event is open and free to everyone and we will also have PIZZA!
