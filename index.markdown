The Open Source Connector aims to create a new forum for collaboration and knowledge sharing around open-source software development in Vermont and the surrounding region. Our goal is to support engagement between academia, industry, and government while driving real impact in the local community. We are funded by the [James Jefford Grant](https://www.uvm.edu/provost/james-jeffords-grants) and organized by the [Vermont Research Open Source Program Office (VERSO)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/) and faculty at [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/) and [Champlain College](https://www.champlain.edu/).
