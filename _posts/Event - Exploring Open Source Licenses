Open source software has revolutionized the tech world, offering a world of possibilities to developers and users alike. However, this digital frontier comes with its own set of rules and guidelines known as open source licenses. In an inaugural talk hosted by the Open Source Connector, David Kopec, an Associate Professor at Champlain College, will delve into the essential aspects of open source licenses. This event promises to be an enlightening journey, exploring the rights and responsibilities of incorporating open source libraries into your projects, the importance of these licenses, an overview of various open source license types, and the best practices for those engaged in open source development.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your journey in open source software, this event, open to all and even featuring delicious pizza, is a valuable opportunity to broaden your horizons. Join us at the Champlain College Campus, and stay tuned for the details of this exciting hybrid event that combines in-person and Zoom participation.
